# Width

In AR, the viewing angle of the text is not always straight in front ofthe user as compared to conventional screens. The text can be presentin the environment around the user to make it more immersive; thisintroduces the issue of perspective distortion in the text.&#x20;

Viewing text at an angle sometimes merges the adjacent&#x20;strokes and affects the visibility of counters in narrow typefacesmaking it very hard to distinguish between letters. In traffic signs,information is parsed similarly, at an acute angle. However, thechallenge in AR is more complicated since the text presented can beparagraphs as opposed to few words in signages.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Typefaces with wider letter shapes perform well in terms of legibility as most of the text in XR is placed at a distance as compared to conventional mediums.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* In condensed typefaces, letters become too narrow when viewed at an angle. Which brings the vertical strokes together and causes legibility issues.
* Condensed typefaces perform poorly in cases of distance viewing too.
* Wider typefaces perform better in a variety of use cases. But they occupy more space hence fitting a lesser number of characters per line.
* Letter shapes with a wider body also reduce the effect of halation and irradiation since the space between the strokes is preserved.
