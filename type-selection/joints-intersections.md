# Joints/Intersections

The thinning of strokes at joints is a regular practice in type design,to visually compensate for heavy spots at the junctions.

In XR headsets the excessive glow of pixels (irradiation) distorts the shape&#x20;of the character which becomes a cause of worry as it hampers legibility.

Monolinear typefaces with very low stroke modulation suffer from distortion and excess glow at the joints.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

While selecting the typefaces, do extensive testing on the headsets and observe the joints. &#x20;

* Check if the strokes become thinner at the joints (observe bare eyes).
* See if they appear heavy at the junctions (on headsets).
* Observe the change in the shape of the letters (on headsets).

Look for typefaces that compensate for heaviness in joints via stroke modulation or ink-traps (in our scenario **light traps**, a corresponding term used by me to address the need for XR headsets).
