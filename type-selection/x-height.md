# x-height

**x-height** is the height of the lowercase letters, disregarding ascenders or descenders, typically exemplified by the letter x. The relationship of the x-height to the body defines the perceived type size. A typeface with a large x-height looks much bigger than a typeface with a small x-height at the same size.

The typefaces with large x-height render well in busy backgrounds by&#x20;allowing counters of an optimum size which aid legibility. Especially,the letters with three horizontal strokes such as a,e,s benefit fromhigher x-height.

{% hint style="info" %}
Typefaces with large x-height are more legible when viewed at a distance because the large x-height results in large counters. However, too large x-height can lead to the misrecognition of letters.\
The x-height should be optimised to get a right&#x20;balance between the ascender and the counter size keeping in mindthe deterioration caused by rounding and irradiation.

* The impact of x-height ceases to exist width of the letter  &#x20;is small. Hence these two factors should be considered in tandem.
* In the case of letters with two horizontal strokes (o,z,b,d,p,q)  large x-height does not affect the legibility much.
* Use of large x-height in some cases might lead to misrecognition among the letters if the x-height overpowers the ascenders&#x20;  height (see image ), which usually get suppressed by rounding at  &#x20;the edges because of irradiation thereby decreasing the legibility.
* Ascenders play a huge role in letter recognition as compared to descenders.
* x-height does not help if the counters are narrow and strokes merge into each other when viewed at an angle.&#x20;
