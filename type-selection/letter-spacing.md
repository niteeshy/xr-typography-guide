# Letter-Spacing

As compared to other mediums spacing plays a decisive factor in XR. Tightly spaced letters in XR cause significant legibility issues, they&#x20;crowd and interfere with each other making it hard to recognise&#x20;individual letters. Hence, it becomes necessary to have good spacing between letters to compensate for the merging of strokes in perspective view&#x20;and crowding, taking into consideration the perceived width of thes trokes and the letters due to irradiation and chromatic aberration.

The spacingin XR should be such that it balances internal and external spaces&#x20;without compromising the reading speed.

The magnitude of crowding decreases with the increase in&#x20;the separation between adjacent characters, a simple way to minimise&#x20;crowding in the text is to increase the spacing between adjacent&#x20;characters.

The spacing should not cross a certain&#x20;threshold, beyond which it starts affecting the reading speed.

Make sure you choose a typeface with loose spacing instead of spacing it yourself manually. Since manual spacing works as a whole and applies to all letters, it tends to mess up with kerning and other optical adjustments done by the typeface designer.
