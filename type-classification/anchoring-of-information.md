# Anchoring of Information

Anchored to head: In this case, the information moves along with the head movement of the user and always stay in front of him/her.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not anchor long running text (pragraphs) to the head of the user. In most headsets long lines will appear to be distorted in the ends so users might face legibility issues. As a normal behaviour, our head tends to move a few degrees all the time. Hence when reading text anchored to the head the slight head movements result in jitter which is not a good reading experience.
{% endhint %}

Anchored to space: The virtual elements are anchored to real-world coordinates in 3D space around the user. Hence the information stays at a particular position and the user sees it only when he/she is looking in its direction.
