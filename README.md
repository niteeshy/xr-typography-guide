# Get Started

Weâ€™re entering a future where reading doesnâ€™t just happen on flat screens, but inside space itself. In the early days of AR and VR, text was almost an afterthought. Rendering limitations, eye comfort, and poor tech support kept it minimal. That picture is shifting. Spatial interfaces now rely on text everywhere, labels, captions, chat, code and even full documents.

As text becomes central to how we interact in XR, new questions surface. How do we keep type legible while moving? How do scale, distance, gaze, and light change stroke contrast? Which placements help reduce fatigue and improve comprehension?

This resource is built around those questions. It began during my masterâ€™s in Typeface Design at the University of Reading in 2017 and continues across todayâ€™s headsets: Meta Ray-Ban Display, Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, HoloLens, Magic Leap...

As the tech is growing rapidly, I'll do my best to keep these guidelines updated with regular additions based on my findings.

#### How to use this resource

The documentation is organised in layers: core concepts, factors that shape reading, and a way to classify text by use. If youâ€™re skimming, start with **Classification** and **Type Selection**. Youâ€™ll also find short hints that highlight the most important takeaways for your XR project.
